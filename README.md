## Release v1.0.0

This extension restores the **Auto Merge** button and **Threshold** field directly to the 3D Viewport header in Blender 5.0, removing the need to dig through the "Options" menu.

### ✨ Features
- **One-Click Access**: Toggles Auto Merge directly from the header.
- **Dynamic Threshold**: The distance setting appears automatically when merging is enabled.
- **Optimized UI**: Only visible in Edit Mode to keep Object Mode clean.

### 🛠 Installation
1. Download the `restore_automerge_header.zip` from this release.
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions**.
3. Click the **Arrow Menu (top right) > Install from Disk**.
4. Select the downloaded ZIP.
